## <a name="introduction">‚ú® Introduction</a>

Apple-style 3D website built with React, Three.js, GSAP, and TailwindCSS! Showcase products in immersive 3D scenes, scroll-animated models, and pinned sections. It features responsive design, smooth timeline animations, and visually striking image transitions, perfect for developers creating interactive, modern web experiences.

## <a name="tech-stack">‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack</a>

- **[CodeRabbit](https://jsm.dev/mbook-coderabbit)** is an AI-powered code review tool that integrates with IDEs like VS Code and Git platforms like GitHub and GitLab. It provides real-time, context-aware feedback on pull requests, including line-by-line analysis, security vulnerability detection, and adherence to coding standards. CodeRabbit learns from your team's preferences, adapting its reviews over time to enhance code quality and developer productivity.

- **[GSAP](https://gsap.com/)** is a powerful JavaScript animation library used in this project to create dynamic, scroll-driven visuals. Features include SplitText animations for bold text reveals, ScrollTrigger for timeline control, parallax scrolling, pinned sections, scroll-synced video playback, seamless multi-section timelines, image masking effects, and a fully custom animated carousel.

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** is a declarative JavaScript library for building interactive UIs. It provides the component structure for modular development, allowing smooth integration of GSAP animations, reusable logic for scroll behavior, and support for responsive layout and state-driven UI features like carousels and video sections.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** is a powerful JavaScript 3D library used in this project to render interactive 3D graphics in the browser. Features include WebGL-based rendering, support for cameras, lights, and materials, 3D model importing, geometry and texture manipulation, scene graph management, animation capabilities, raycasting for interactivity, and integration with physics and post-processing effects for immersive experiences.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** is a lightning-fast build tool and development server that powers this project‚Äôs workflow. It enables instant hot module replacement, fast startup, and optimized production builds‚Äîideal for an animation-heavy React site with smooth, real-time development feedback and minimal config.

## <a name="features">üîã Features</a>

üëâ **3D Product Scene with Realistic Lighting System**: Showcase products in lifelike 3D environments for maximum visual impact.

üëâ **Animate 3D Model on Scroll**: Create immersive interactions by animating 3D models based on user scroll position.

üëâ **ScrollTrigger Effects**: Power scroll-based animations and timeline control with GSAP‚Äôs ScrollTrigger.

üëâ **Pinned Sections**: Lock sections in view while animating content for engaging scroll experiences.

üëâ **Image Masking Effects**: Use scroll-triggered pins and masks for visually striking image transitions.

üëâ **Seamless Timeline Animations**: Craft smooth animation timelines that span across multiple sections.

üëâ **Responsive Design**: Ensure fluid UI and adaptive GSAP animations across all screen sizes.

And many more, including code architecture and reusability.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities,](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-standalone-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `bunx nx graph` to explore what was created visually. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
bunx nx serve gsap-macbook-landing
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
bunx nx build gsap-macbook-landing
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
bunx nx show project gsap-macbook-landing
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you can manually add new projects to your workspace, you can leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
bunx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
bunx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `bunx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `bunx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
bunx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
bunx nx g ci-workflow
```
